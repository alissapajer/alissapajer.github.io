quotients

Z/3Z

equivalence classes - elements which differ by an element of the "bottom" are in the same equivalence class

they are proper vector spaces - i.e. we can add them and multiply them by a constant in field K

homology example with a simplicial complex

show inclusion maps as we add more and more elements in the complex

consider H_0, H_1, H_2, H_3 - these are all quotient spaces!

at the end bring it all around to category theory - H_k is a "homology functor" - see Notation section at the end of the intro to the zigzag survey paper https://arxiv-export1.library.cornell.edu/pdf/2210.00916.pdf

cohomology in the same context of quotient spaces

covariant vs contravariant functors (homology vs cohomology functors) - see AT by Thatcher for a good introduction
