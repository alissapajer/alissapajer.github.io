# Slices of Topology

No matter how you slice it and dice it, you get out the same information. Well, that's not exactly true. But I'll show you a couple different ways you can slice it.

## Set Up

This is basically a hollow donut with legs. Said differently, it's a shell of a sphere that has a hole in it (so it's like a torus), with the lower bits dragged out. This three-dimensional shape has six critical values, which are local minima and local maxima. They are labelled as $a_1$ through $a_6$.
