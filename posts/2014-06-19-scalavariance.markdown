title: Notions of Variance in Scala

Here is a [github gist](https://gist.github.com/alissapajer/50c912d739346c1f00dd) with some exercises explaining variance of functors in Scala. Additionally, it explains variance of types over their type parameters.

I also wrote up a [proof](/images/FunctorMorphismPreservationProof.pdf) that a given functor implementation preserves morphism composition.
